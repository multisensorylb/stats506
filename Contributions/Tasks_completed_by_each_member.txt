- Setup GitHub
- Data converted to excel (using SAS- could have been done using R, but could be useful when implementing modelling algorithms using 
  SAS)
- Data dictionary created (using R)

Proposed idea for project: "Test whether the salt intake behavior of a person is related to the person's blood pressure levels and 
analyze if this relationship is dependent on the waist measurement of the person" We will use nutrient_1day, body_measures, 
blood_pressure for this and the analysis would be a moderation analysis testing whether there exists a relationship between salt intake 
and blood pressure levels and if this relationship is moderated by waist measurement. 

As a follow up analysis, we will study "whether the quantity of salt intake of a person is related to the person's blood pressure levels 
and identify whether age is a mechanism underlying the relationship between the two", i.e., is age a mediator between the relationship 
between salt intake and blood pressure levels? This would be a  mediation analysis with a confidence interval-based bootstrapping 
approach. This analysis will use demographics, nutrients_1day and blood_pressure data.

Committed a rough draft of the initial R script for implementing a moderation mediation model that included 
  - Merging and creating the model ready data. 
  - Building a moderation model at: 1) mean 2) 1 SD below mean 3) 1 SD above mean
  - Building a mediation model with and without bootstraps.

Committed the SAS version of the above script. This includes comments and observations taken from Jingyan's submission in this file. 

12/5/2019
Created a report of the results using output from the SAS scripts for the models. 

The concise list of the files I have worked on are: 

--> stats506/Codes/R/
	createDataDict.R
	med_mod_code.R (Initial draft of the analysis)
  
--> stats506/Codes/SAS/
	covertData_toExcel.sas
	sastutorial_506.sas
  
--> stats506/RawData/
	All of the files under this folder.

--> stats506/Results&Reports/
	SAS Report- sastutorial_506.htm

Proposed idea for project: We can use the datasets nutrient_1day, supplements_1day and demographic (as the name on Github) to deal with 
the  question "Do people who have less daily nutrient intake tend to take more supplements?" (nutrient here can be protein, Vitamin, 
etc.). The  response is one of the dietary supplements and the predictors can include nutrient intake, age, gender, and pir (more 
predictors can be  included). Linear regression is used first and then the advanced technique. If the coefficient of nutrient is 
negative, the answer could be yes.
