# stats506
This is a github repository for the final project for stats 506 consisting of gkarthik@umich.edu, andrealu@umich.edu and lixinjun@umich.edu. 

For now we have decided to choose one amongst the following models for the final project: 

1. Moderation and mediation
2. Robust regression
3. lasso
4. PCA, regression and model selection
5. Linear, ridge and lasso and compare models
6. bootstrap for linear regression
7. linear regression followed by marginal effects

Some raw data is too big to be uploaded on git. You can download those from here: https://umich.app.box.com/folder/93901427237
